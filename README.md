# Vineyard-Identification
A project to identify and mark vineyards. Globally.

How many vineyards are there in the world? Where are they? What is the climate 
and weather like in those locations? How are changes in the weather and eventually 
the climate going to change the production and quality of wine in the world?

It's a seemingly simple question that gets very complicated quickly.

There were about 6.7 million ha of vines in production globally in 2017. There are 
1.5 billion ha of agricultural production globally. So vineyard production is only 
.004 percent of global agriculture.

If you want to know where wine is growing in the world, you're going to have to go 
out and find it hidden within a hystack of agricultural production.

Fortunately, most viticulture occurs in relatively restricted geographic areas. 
The global limitations are pretty basic.

<i>Vitis vinifera</i> grows globally between 30 and 50 degrees North and South 
latitiude. These areas are roughly contiguous with temperature bands between 
10 and 20C

This still leaves a lot of ground to cover. Satellite imagery is an obvious starting 
point. A quick examination of several options leads to the realization that the level
of detail needed will be quite high:
